Doesn't have an official name; unfinished.

How to run (What's here now anyway):

Click "Clone or Download"

Click "Run in Visual Studio"

It should automatically open VS; if not select Visual Studio as your application.

Once it opens, named the cloned repository and select the directory (where you want it to go).

Clone the repository. After this it should automatically open.

Open "Program.cs" within the open project.

Test it with "Start without Debugging"

After you test it, click "Build"

Go to the directory folder you chose, and open it

Open the "bin" folder

Open the "Debug" folder

Run the .exe file.

It should run the program. You can move this .exe file anywere; it will still work. However, if you build the program again, it will create another .exe file.
